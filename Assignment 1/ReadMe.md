## Assignment 1 
The language chosen for the program is python.

The code accepts a string as input and iterates over positive integers until an integer is found that, when appended to the string, produces a hash that is less than the target.

The execution time until the nonce value is found has been printed as well.

    Example:
        For the input string 'IITK', the output of the code is :
        The smallest nonce is : 14
        The time taken by the program to get the nonce value is : 1.5564820766448975 seconds

        Note: The time taken is according to the VS Code Terminal in my system.
